# 🚨 URGENT: Fix Render Deployment

The CORS error shows Render is still using old code. Here's how to fix it:

## Problem

You're seeing:
```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin does not match 'http://localhost:5173'
```

This means Render hasn't deployed the latest code yet, or `NODE_ENV` is not set.

---

## ✅ Solution: Update Render Environment Variables

### Step 1: Go to Render Dashboard

1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click on your service: **chaturway-app**

### Step 2: Add NODE_ENV Environment Variable

1. Go to **"Environment"** tab
2. Click **"Add Environment Variable"**
3. Add:
   ```
   Key:   NODE_ENV
   Value: production
   ```
4. Click **"Save Changes"**

### Step 3: Force Redeploy

1. Go to **"Manual Deploy"** tab
2. Click **"Deploy latest commit"**
3. Wait 2-5 minutes for deployment

## 🔍 How to Check if it Worked

After deployment, check the **Logs** tab. You should see:

```
🌍 CORS Configuration:
   NODE_ENV: production
   Allowed origins: [ 'http://localhost:5173', 'http://localhost:3000' ]
```

When you try to signup, you should see:
```
🔍 CORS check for origin: https://your-netlify-app.netlify.app
✅ Allowing: production environment
```

---

## ⚠️ Why This Happened

The CORS fix requires:
1. ✅ Latest code (already pushed to GitHub)
2. ✅ NODE_ENV = production (YOU NEED TO ADD THIS)
3. ✅ Manual redeploy (to pick up changes)

Without `NODE_ENV`, the code treats it as development mode!

## 📋 Environment Variables Checklist

Make sure you have **ALL** of these in Render:

- ✅ **MONGO_URI** - Your MongoDB connection string
- ✅ **JWT_SECRET** - Your secret key (from JWT_SECRET_KEY.md)
- ✅ **OPENAI_API_KEY** - Your OpenAI key (from JWT_SECRET_KEY.md)
- ✅ **CLIENT_URL** - Your Netlify frontend URL
- ✅ **NODE_ENV** - Set to `production` ← **ADD THIS NOW!**

---

## 🚀 After Adding NODE_ENV

1. Save the environment variable
2. Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"
3. Wait for deployment
4. Check logs to verify it worked
5. Test signup on Netlify

**Add NODE_ENV=production and redeploy NOW!** 🚨
