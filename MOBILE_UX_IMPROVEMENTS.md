# ✅ Mobile UI/UX Improvements

## What's Been Fixed

### 1. ✅ Mobile Sidebar Navigation
- **Problem:** Sidebar was always visible on mobile, taking up too much space
- **Solution:** 
  - Hidden sidebar on mobile (`hidden md:flex`)
  - Added hamburger menu button on mobile
  - Created slide-out overlay sidebar for mobile navigation
  - Sidebar auto-closes when user selects a chat

### 2. ✅ Dark Background Overlay
- **Problem:** Light yellow/bright overlay was distracting
- **Solution:** Darkened overlay from `bg-black/60` to `bg-black/70`

### 3. ✅ Better Mobile Contrast
- **Problem:** Text on white backgrounds wasn't visible
- **Solution:** Improved background colors and ensured proper dark mode support
